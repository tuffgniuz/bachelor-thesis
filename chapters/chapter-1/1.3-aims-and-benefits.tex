\section{Aims and Benefits}

\subsection{Aims}
Software code is the essence of each application. Applications that we use daily might be processing important and sensitive assets. Therefore, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of those assets are at risk of being compromised. However, adding security might be a challenging task. The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate how security can be added to the SDLC by constructing sensible security requirements to CHEFEED. The security requirements will be based of the OWASP ASVS and MASVS by utilizing OWASP SKF.

\subsection{Benefits}
Secure programming forces developers to improve coding standards as well as the overall coding architecture. Adding security to the SDL will save development time, since there is no need to add new code after security audits are performed.
