\section{Scope}
The thesis focuses on fundamental security concepts and principles. They will be applied by developing the CHEFEED application. CHEFEED will have an API and a hybrid native client. The application will go through a secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). An important principle in information security is to find a good balance between security and productivity. Thus, a security maturity model and a standard for writing secure code will guide the SDLC. Adding security into the SDLC will allow to have secure code by design, instead of having security as an afterthought. Furthermore, security tests will be performed in the form of penetration tests and security code reviews.

CHEFEED is a group effort and the scope and responsibilities outside this thesis are summarized in Table \ref{tab:member-scope}.
