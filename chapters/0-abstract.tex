Application security grows more and more important as both web and native applications are becoming more prevalent. It is not uncommon for sensitive data being exposed due to insecure code. The latest Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top Ten release revealed that injection vulnerabilities still ranks as number three, implying that software developers do not properly know how to mitigate these vulnerabilities or are simply not aware of these. Broken access control and cryptographic failures takes the first and second place respectively on the list. However, this problem can be solved by taking application security seriously and adding it into the software development life cycle. This thesis proposes adding the OWASP Security Knowledge Framework to the software development life cycle through a 
case study.
