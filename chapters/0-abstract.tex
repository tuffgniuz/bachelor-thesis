Application security grows more and more important as both web and native applications
are becoming more prevalent. It is not uncommon for sensitive data being ex-
posed due to insecure code. The latest Open Web Application Security Project
(OWASP) Top Ten release revealed that injection vulnerabilities still ranks as
number three, implying that software developers do not properly know how to
mitigate these vulnerabilities or are simply not aware of these. Broken access
control and cryptographic failures takes the first and second place respectively on
the list. However, this problem can be solved by taking application security seri-
ously and adding it into the software development life cycle. This article proposes
adding the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard and OWASP Se-
curity Knowledge Framework to the software development life cycle through a
case study. It is expected to have a better understanding of code vulnerabilities
and how to properly mitigate them. In the end, the paper explores how software
developers can be adequate in writing secure code with the assistance of proper
tools.
