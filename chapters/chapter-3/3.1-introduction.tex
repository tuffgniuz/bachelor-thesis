\section{Project Description}
This chapter describes the functional and technical requirements for developing the API and client for the application (CHEFEED) that will be developed as a case-study for this thesis. Therefore, the emphasis for the software design will be on the software's security.
CheFeed will allow create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations for posts, comments and accounts withing the native applications given the user is authenticated and authorized to do so.

The Application Programing Interface (API) will be developed with FastAPI, a modern, high-perfomace, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6 and above with support for Python type hints. The client side will be developed with React Native, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces for both iOS and Android devices.
