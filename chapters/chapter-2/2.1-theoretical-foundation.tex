\section{Information Security}
This section defines information security, specifically on how it is different from cybersecurity. Moreover, the section will discuss how the evolution of computers and the World Wide Web has introduced challenges to information security. Lastly this section defines what secure by design means.

\subsection{Defining Information Security}
It is critical to understand what precisely is implied when discussing security. Therefore, we have to properly define it. For instance, the terms cybersecurity and information security are commonly used indistinguishably. The Cambridge Dictionary defines information security as \say{methods used to prevent electronic information from being illegally obtained or used}, and defines cybersecurity as \say{things that are done to protect a person, organization, or country and their computer information against crime or attacks carried out using the internet}. The definition for cybersecurity describes a much larger scope for security. 

Solms et al \cite{von_Solms_2013} supports this argument and reasons that information security is solely about securing the information, generally referred to as the asset, from potential threats posed by inherent vulnerabilities. Furthermore, they outlined that cybersecurity goes beyond protecting assets. Cybersecurity includes the insurance of those that operate in cyberspace in addition to any of their assets that can be achieved through cyberspace. Although the definition of information security and cybersecurity overlap each other, the latter is much more extensive in its definition. Overall, security is about securing assets against the most probable types of attacks, to the best ability \cite{andress2014the}.

Information security can be defined as the protection of information from potential abuse subsequent from various threats and vulnerabilities \cite{von_Solms_2013}. In a general sense, security means protecting our data and systems assets from whoever who intends to misuse it. It includes several aspects of business, involving financial controls, human resources and protection of the physical environment, as well as health and safety measures \cite{zinatullin2016the}. Security strives to secure ourselves against the most likely forms of attack, to the best ability.
