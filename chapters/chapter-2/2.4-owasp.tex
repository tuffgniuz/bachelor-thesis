\section{OWASP - Security with Open Source Tools}
Without the proper tools it is much more difficult to defend against cyberattacks, and as discussed in Section \ref{sec:challenges-in-is} security has several challenges. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit foundation dedicated on improving the security of software through its open source software projects led by the community from all over the world. In addition, OWASP hosts local and global conferences to improve software security \cite{owasp_about}. For two decades OWASP has provided the tools needed to better secure the software with projects like the ASVS, SKF, SAMM and many more.
