% Overview of general security testing principals
\section{Security Testing}
Security testing is about ensuring that the software being developed behaves properly when the software is intentionally being abused, and thus the security controls operate as expected. Therefore, potential risks must be identified and their impact. In a 2004 paper by Potter B, and McGraw G, the importance of security testing was already emphasized \cite{Potter_2004}. In summary security testing involves two diverse approaches:

\begin{itemize}
    \item security mechanisms such as cryptography, strong authentication, and access control should be tested to ensure their functionality is correctly implemented, and
    \item risk-based security testing encouraged by understanding and simulating the attackers approach should be performed.
\end{itemize}

Indeed, performing security test is important. However, the question then is; when should security tests be performed? Too often security and security tests are still an afterthought. In reality, this is ineffective and expensive. To prevent security bugs from even appearing in production is to enhance the SDLC and integrate security into each phase \cite{owasp_testing_guide}.
